    <p> Formula One (also known as Formula 1 or F1) is the highest class of international racing for open-wheel single-seater formula racing cars sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). The World Drivers' Championship, which became the FIA Formula One World Championship in 1981, has been one of the premier forms of racing around the world since its inaugural season in 1950. The word formula in the name refers to the set of rules to which all participants' cars must conform. A Formula One season consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix, which take place worldwide on both purpose-built circuits and closed public roads.</p>
    <P>A points system is used at Grands Prix to determine two annual World Championships: one for drivers, the other for constructors. Each driver must hold a valid Super Licence, the highest class of racing licence issued by the FIA. The races must run on tracks graded "1" (formerly "A"), the highest grade-rating issued by the FIA.</P>

        <h2>First formula 1 Race</h2>
        <ul>
          <p> The first Formula 1 race was the 1946 Turin Grand Prix. A number of Grand Prix racing organisations had laid out rules for a world championship before World War II, but due to the suspension of racing during the conflict, the World Drivers' Championship did not become formalised until 1947.</p>

      <h2>The First Formula 1 Car</h2>
      <p> The  BRM P15 was a race-winning car, built using this wooden buck to form the chassis around in 1949. In 1950 it took the victory at F1's Goodwood meet (not part of the world championship but still an F1 event) when Reg Parnell beat Prince Bira's Maserati by nearly 14 seconds in a 20-minute race.</p>
      <p>F1 cars have become dramatically faster over time. Current F1 cars are estimated to be twice as fast as the first ones. However, old F1 cars were also quite fast. F1 cars from the 1950s and 1960s could accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h in about four seconds, and their estimated top speed was 290 km/h.</p>

      <h2>On the road</h2>
      <p>Of course, the F1 power unit itself is a marvel – without doubt the most efficient engine on the planet. Compare the latest V6 turbo-hybrid power unit to the normally aspirated V8 used up to 2013: 20% more power, and yet it produces 26% less in the way of CO2 emissions. </p>
      <p> In the world of automobiles, the term ‘thermal efficiency’ is often used when speaking about engine performance. In simple terms, this describes the percentage of the energy from combustion that moves a car forward, as opposed to being lost as heat. In the V8 era, thermal efficiency peaked at 29%. With the introduction of the V6 turbo-hybrids in 2014, that figure leapt almost immediately to around 40% - and it now stands at over 50%. Yes, that’s right, F1 engines have become 10% more efficient in six years, such is the rapid pace of development.</p>

      <h2>Sporting performance</h2>
      <p>The expertise of F1 teams in aerodynamics and carbon fibre technology has seen F1 engineering being called upon in multiple other sports, including sailing, bobsleigh and cycling.
        For example, McLaren worked with cycle firm Specialized to create the lightweight, carbon fibre ‘Venge’ racing bike, which was both lighter and stiffer than the standard model - and unsurprisingly became a race winner almost immediately.
      </p>
      <p>Those same efficiency gains have been used in the America’s Cup, too, with the likes of Red Bull’s Adrian Newey and former McLaren boss Martin Whitmarsh involved with the world’s best sailing teams that harness the power of hydrodynamics – much like aerodynamics – to gain an advantage.</p>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="column" style="background-color:white;">
      <h2>Changing cities</h2>
      <p>Public transport also benefits from the efforts of F1 teams, with McLaren Applied Technologies using F1-derived technology to develop 5G infrastructure for connected road, rail and underground transportation, while sensors and data tools that started life in F1 are now used in the Singapore Mass Rapid Transit system among others.</p>
      <p>McLaren’s F1 data hasn't just stayed on the ground either, as it is now used by air traffic controllers to predict which departures and arrivals are most likely to happen out of schedule at an airport by running thousands of simulations every second on-the-fly – avoiding congestion, saving time and emissions.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="column" style="background-color:white;">
      <h2>Saving lives</h2>
      <p>Parallels have been drawn numerous times between drivers and their engineers – and doctors with their patients. In both cases, data is key, so hospitals are using McLaren’s data systems to continuously monitor patients in intensive care wards, not only helping doctors care better for their patients but find trends and conduct vital research. F1 sensors, for example, have been placed on surgeons’ elbows while they operate, allowing for ultra-specific feedback.</p>
      <p>The fastest pit stops in motor sport have also saved lives, as both Great Ormond Street Hospital and the University Hospital of Wales have found. The former took cues from Ferrari in the 1990s and the latter was heavily influenced by Williams in 2016 to improve communication between surgeons, nurses and anaesthetists in operating theatres – among other crucial, life-saving improvements in their Cardiff hospital.</p>
